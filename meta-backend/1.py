# Make a cup of coffee
"""Exercise: Make a cup of coffee
Introduction
In this exercise, you will practice the use of an algorithm to make a cup of instant coffee. The purpose is to lay out the steps required in order to get the final product. 

Instructions"""
# Step 1: Start with the inputs - what is needed to make a cup of instant coffee?
# input("How many gram of coffee: ")
# input("How many mil of water: ")
# input("do you want hot or ice coffee: ")

# Step 2: Think about all the steps required in the physical aspect of making a cup of instant coffee.
# put coffee
# boil water
# adding ice

# Step 3: Consider the edge cases of optional things like milk or sugar, some people may want it.
# input("do you want adding milk or sugar: ")
# input("How many gram of milk: ")
# input("How many gram of sugar: ")

# Step 4: The algorithm when complete should have as its final result a cup of coffee.
# print("this is your milk, sugar, hot, ice coffee")

# Tips: Planning is key with any algorithm. Make sure you have all the steps neatly laid out.
